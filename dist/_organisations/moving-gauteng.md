  We are a small team of public transport and data enthusiasts who set out to take on the challenge of creating integrated public transport data. We created Moving Gauteng to be a platform to help commuters to move around Gauteng. We spend evenings and weekends mapping Gauteng's public transport network, tracking buses and calculating schedule timings, and building services on top of the data that we create.
