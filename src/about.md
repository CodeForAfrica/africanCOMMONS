Civic technologists do not need to reinvent the wheel. Civic software solutions to pressing developmental challenges already exist elsewhere in the world, and often simply need be customised or adapted to local requirements.

Locally developed software solutions are also appropriate for reuse elsewhere on the continent, and the wider world. The challenge is discovery: end-user organisations and technologists are seldom aware of existing solutions elsewhere and/or struggle to find credible recommendations that are sensitive to local operational requirements.

AfricanCOMMONS is a platform to showcase re-useable tools built across Africa and the people & organizations building them.
